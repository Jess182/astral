Astral is a relatively complicated library with a few moving parts. Getting to
know about them is critical if you want to contribute (or you're just curious!)

The project is mainly composed of three components:

- A Chrome / Firefox binary to run
- Bindings generated for those binaries
- A layer on top of that for a nicer API
